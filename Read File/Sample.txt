This chapter will familiarize you with the framework we値l use
throughout the book to think about the design and analysis of
algorithms. It is self-contained, but it does include several references to
material that will be introduced in Chapters 3 and 4. (It also contains
several summations, which Appendix A shows how to solve.)
We値l begin by examining the insertion sort algorithm to solve the
sorting problem introduced in Chapter 1. We値l specify algorithms using
a pseudocode that should be understandable to you if you have done
computer programming. We値l see why insertion sort correctly sorts and
analyze its running time. The analysis introduces a notation that
describes how running time increases with the number of items to be
sorted. Following a discussion of insertion sort, we値l use a method
called divide-and-conquer to develop a sorting algorithm called merge
sort. We値l end with an analysis of merge sort痴 running time.
